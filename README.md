# University Crime Watch #
University Crime Watch - a web app that allows users to view crime data for 2011 - 2013 for higher education institutions across the United States. This was my group's final project in April 2015 during Dev Bootcamp.

### My Contributions ###
* the look and feel of the app: gathering references and going over with teammates, web design from Photoshop mockups for each page, responsive design, logo, the school comparison animated bar graphs and table charts
* writing the script to grab the school's acronym from the data object in order to render it for the school's profile page and associate its nicknames for the search bar
* populated the scatter plot with c3.js to show all the schools and their crime data. However, due to the heavy amount of data we had (11,000 schools), the scatter plot was hard to read. Thus, we moved it and replaced it with:
* writing the script for ticking number stats on the landing page

### Technologies Used ###
* Ruby on Rails - Backend
* Bootstrap - Responsive grid layout
* C3.js - Data visualization
* Jquery UI - Auto-Complete
* Datamaps.js - Sort by state
* GoogleMaps API - Heat map of school crimes
